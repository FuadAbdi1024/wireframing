# 🧩 Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## 📌 Introduction

**Wireframing** is a crucial step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating low-fidelity visual representations of a product’s layout and structure before any actual development begins.

Wireframes serve as a blueprint for the interface — outlining the placement of elements like navigation menus, buttons, content sections, and images — without focusing on style, color, or graphics.

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarifies Layout and Structure:** Helps stakeholders and designers understand where each component will appear on the screen.
- **Early Feedback:** Allows for fast, low-cost adjustments before moving to high-fidelity designs or development.
- **Improves Collaboration:** Aligns the team (designers, developers, clients) by visually communicating the user flow and functionality.
- **Saves Time and Resources:** Identifies potential usability issues early in the process, reducing rework later in development.
